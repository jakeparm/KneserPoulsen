Simulations for Kneser Poulsen Conjecture

This repository contains files related to my undergraduate thesis project titled "A Computational Approach to the Kneser Poulsen Conjecture". This was a project aimed at searching for counterexamples to the conjecture using a probability based approach. The python files were used to verify theoretically derived constants and inequalities, as well as running simulations of the conjecture itself.
